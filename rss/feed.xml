Defense expert: Batey did 'jackass' things due to alcohol

<![CDATA[<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This story contains graphic content and may be disturbing to some readers.</em></p><p>(NASHVILLE) An&nbsp;expert brought in by defense attorneys told a jury Tuesday that&nbsp;in the early morning hours of June 23, 2013, Cory Batey&nbsp;was drunk enough&nbsp;to do &quot;silly things, jackass things.&quot;</p><p>What prosecutors say Batey did that day was rape an unconscious 21-year-old woman in a Vanderbilt University dorm.</p><p>Jonathan Lipman testified for the defense on Tuesday in Batey&#39;s second day of trial. Batey, a former Vanderbilt football player accused of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery,&nbsp;has faced a jury before.&nbsp;But a mistrial was declared in June, leading to Batey&#39;s retrial, which began Monday.</p> &nbsp; <p>Lipman could not be in Nashville later in the week so he testified early. The state is still presenting its witnesses, including Metro police Detective Chad Gish, who testified Tuesday.</p> <p>Gish seized phones from the four former players charged in the case and analyzed them. He found graphic thumbnail photographs&nbsp;on the phones belonging to Batey,Brandon Vandenburg and Brandon E. Banks, he said, but none on the phone of Jaborian &quot;Tip&quot; McKenzie.</p><p>Vandenburg previously stood trial with Batey, and faces trial in June. Cases involving the other two men are pending.</p><p>In those pictures, Gish said, it appeared Batey was penetrating the woman with his finger and squatting on her face, raising a middle finger. Other images, Gish said, showed Batey touching and photographing the woman&rsquo;s private parts.</p><p>Batey, 22, stole glances at his mother and supporters as the pictures were shown. Jurors trained their eyes on a big screen TV, turned away from the public, that displayed the pictures.</p><p>Gish is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.</p> &nbsp; <p>Another police detective, Jason Mayo, led the investigation of the incident at Vanderbilt. When Mayo&nbsp;interviewed Batey three days later, Batey said he helped Vandenburg with a drunk woman and&nbsp;denied touching her, according to a recording of that interview that was played in court.</p> <p>Lipman, an expert on how alcohol influences people, told the jury that Batey was so drunk the night of the alleged sexual assault his blood alcohol content would have been between two and five times the legal limit to drive in Tennessee. Lipman estimated Batey&#39;s level of intoxication based on a number of drinks given to him by Batey&#39;s attorneys and another expert in the case.</p><p>Lipman said Batey probably would&nbsp;have been able to function&nbsp;but may have done &quot;silly things, jackass things&quot; that he would not remember.</p><p>Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman attacked the reliability of Lipman&#39;s testimony on cross-examination.&nbsp;Lipman confirmed that his report was based only on self-reported information.</p><p>&quot;There wasn&rsquo;t a bartender keeping tabs,&quot; Lipman said.</p><p>Lipman said he was told Batey had eight to 10 shots in a dorm and then continued drinking. But according to a transcript of Batey&#39;s testimony at his previous trial, which Thurman showed to Lipman,&nbsp;Batey said it was six to eight. Batey said in his testimony he stopped drinking about an hour before the time that was told to Lipman.</p> &nbsp; <p>Lipman said that could mean Batey was less drunk than Lipman estimated. But he said Batey&#39;s&nbsp;inhibitions would have still been impaired, and he would not have acted in a knowing or intentional way.&nbsp;The defense case is, in part, that Batey was blackout drunk and did what others told him to do.</p><p>But Thurman suggested those discrepancies should prompt bigger questions about Lipman&#39;s report.</p> <p>&quot;The scientist is only as good as the data?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;Correct,&quot; Lipman replied.</p><p>&quot;Garbage in, garbage out,&nbsp;right?&quot; Thurman asked.</p><p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Lipman said.</p> ]]>

Batey, a former Vanderbilt football player accused of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery,&nbsp;has faced a jury before.&nbsp;But a mistrial was declared in June, leading to Batey&#39;s retrial, which began Monday.</p> <div id="module-position-O77OHh1r5gY"> <div data-oembed-provider="the-tennessean" data-oembed-type="link"> <div> &nbsp; <p>Lipman could not be in Nashville later in the week so he testified early. The state is still presenting its witnesses, including Metro police Detective Chad Gish, who testified Tuesday.</p> <p>Gish seized phones from the four former players charged in the case and analyzed them. He found graphic thumbnail photographs&nbsp;on the phones belonging to Batey,Brandon Vandenburg and Brandon E. Banks, he said, but none on the phone of Jaborian &quot;Tip&quot; McKenzie.</p><p>Vandenburg previously stood trial with Batey, and faces trial in June. Cases involving the other two men are pending.</p><p>In those pictures, Gish said, it appeared Batey was penetrating the woman with his finger and squatting on her face, raising a middle finger. Other images, Gish said, showed Batey touching and photographing the woman&rsquo;s private parts.</p><p>Batey, 22, stole glances at his mother and supporters as the pictures were shown. Jurors trained their eyes on a big screen TV, turned away from the public, that displayed the pictures.</p><p>Gish is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.</p> <div id="module-position-O77OHh1yb6I"> <div data-oembed-provider="the-tennessean" data-oembed-type="link"> <div> &nbsp; <p>Another police detective, Jason Mayo, led the investigation of the incident at Vanderbilt. When Mayo&nbsp;interviewed Batey three days later, Batey said he helped Vandenburg with a drunk woman and&nbsp;denied touching her, according to a recording of that interview that was played in court.</p> <p>Lipman, an expert on how alcohol influences people, told the jury that Batey was so drunk the night of the alleged sexual assault his blood alcohol content would have been between two and five times the legal limit to drive in Tennessee. Lipman estimated Batey&#39;s level of intoxication based on a number of drinks given to him by Batey&#39;s attorneys and another expert in the case.</p><p>Lipman said Batey probably would&nbsp;have been able to function&nbsp;but may have done &quot;silly things, jackass things&quot; that he would not remember.</p><p>Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman attacked the reliability of Lipman&#39;s testimony on cross-examination.&nbsp;Lipman confirmed that his report was based only on self-reported information.</p><p>&quot;There wasn&rsquo;t a bartender keeping tabs,&quot; Lipman said.</p><p>Lipman said he was told Batey had eight to 10 shots in a dorm and then continued drinking. But according to a transcript of Batey&#39;s testimony at his previous trial, which Thurman showed to Lipman,&nbsp;Batey said it was six to eight. Batey said in his testimony he stopped drinking about an hour before the time that was told to Lipman.</p> <div id="module-position-O77OHh0jATg"> <div> <div data-oembed-provider="the-tennessean" data-oembed-type="link"> <div> <div> &nbsp; <p>Lipman said that could mean Batey was less drunk than Lipman estimated. But he said Batey&#39;s&nbsp;inhibitions would have still been impaired, and he would not have acted in a knowing or intentional way.&nbsp;The defense case is, in part, that Batey was blackout drunk and did what others told him to do.</p><p>But Thurman suggested those discrepancies should prompt bigger questions about Lipman&#39;s report.</p> <p>&quot;The scientist is only as good as the data?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;Correct,&quot; Lipman replied.</p><p>&quot;Garbage in, garbage out,&nbsp;right?&quot; Thurman asked.</p><p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Lipman said.</p> <figure class="op-tracker"> <iframe src="http://interactive.tegna-media.com/lakana/fia/assets/analytics.php?id=51&story=121893827&hls=false&category=600001&callsign=WBIR&article=Defense-expert:-Batey-did-'jackass'-things-due-to-alcohol&type=Facebook-Instant-Article&originurl=www.wbir.com/sports/defense-expert-batey-did-jackass-things-due-to-alcohol/121893827" hidden> </iframe> </figure> <footer> <small> <a href="http://www.wbir.com">WBIR-TV</a> &copy; 2016 TEGNA MEDIA </small> </footer> </article> </body> </html>

<![CDATA[<p>(NASHVILLE) A Tennessee Republican lawmaker is taking flak from an advocacy organization and fellow legislators after&nbsp;distributing a DVD centering on&nbsp;Muslims in America.</p><p>Last week, Rep. Susan Lynn, R-Mt. Juliet, sent&nbsp;her colleagues a documentary entitled &quot;America&#39;s Mosques Exposed!&quot;</p><p>The film includes a summary that states, &quot;Chilling and urgent insider video catches treason in the act against God and Country by Muslims using American Mosques as war factories and by our own U.S.&nbsp;Government, burning Bibles as trash yet ordering Muslim Qurans to be &#39;handled like a delicate piece of art.&#39; &quot;</p><p>The film,&nbsp;produced and narrated by Louie E. Johnston Jr., who runs the website PatriotPastors.net, also suggests that the country&#39;s Muslims are &quot;fundraising for Terrorists.&quot;</p><p>On Tuesday&nbsp;Paul Galloway, executive director of the American Center for Outreach, along with House Democrats&nbsp;took issue with Lynn handing out the film.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s really irresponsible, election-year politicking,&quot; he said, noting&nbsp;that Lynn has a history of targeting members of the Muslim community.</p><p>Galloway and his&nbsp;organization, which describes itself as one&nbsp;that promotes&nbsp;religious liberty and faith-based social justice through advocacy and issue-based coalitions, questioned&nbsp;a bill Lynn sponsored last year, which sought to break up &quot;no-go zones.&quot;</p><p>Lynn&#39;s bill defined such zones as&nbsp;&quot;a contiguous geographical area consisting of public space or privately owned public space where community organizing efforts systematically intimidate or exclude the general public or public workers from entering or being present within the area.&quot;</p><p>Galloway called the legislation anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim &mdash;&nbsp;something that&nbsp;Lynn refuted.</p><p>Galloway said Lynn&#39;s distribution of the DVD, which he said contained&nbsp;questionable and objectionable content,&nbsp;is another form of &quot;fear mongering&quot; against Muslims.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a broad, sweeping indictment of an entire faith,&quot; he said.</p><p>But Lynn disagrees.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t see anything objectionable in it (the DVD),&quot; she told The Tennessean on Tuesday, adding that she specifically talked to the House Clerk about following the&nbsp;proper procedure for handing out materials to lawmakers. &quot;Anything in the video you can see on YouTube every day of the week.&quot;</p><p>Calling it&nbsp;a freedom of speech issue,&nbsp;Lynn said the central aspect of the film focused on Islam as a &quot;political philosophy and not a religion.&quot;</p><p>Galloway said it was &quot;cowardly&quot; for Lynn to hide behind the First Amendment.</p><p>&quot;When you target one faith community, you&#39;re threatening everybody&#39;s faith community and that works against everyone,&quot; he&nbsp;said, adding that elected officials are&nbsp;held to higher standards.</p><p>Galloway&#39;s organization plans to distribute another DVD, entitled &quot;American Muslims: Facts vs. Fiction,&quot;&nbsp;to lawmakers later this week.</p><p>Galloway was not alone in criticizing Lynn, as House Democrats on Tuesday announced they formally filed a workplace harassment&nbsp;complaint with Connie Ridley, the&nbsp;state&#39;s head of legislative human resources.</p><p>&quot;Any Muslim working in this building or in the state legislature would necessarily feel discriminated against and feel like&nbsp;they are working in a hostile working environment,&quot; said Rep.

<![CDATA[<p>The Pigeon Forge Police Department released the names of the five people killed in a fiery sightseeing helicopter crash on Monday afternoon.</p><p>The pilot was Jason Dahl, 38, of Sevierville. The passengers were Johna Morvant, 49, from Kodak and her two children, Peyton and Parker Rasmussen with Huntersville, NC addresses. Also killed in the crash was Michael Glenn Mastalez, 21, of Prosper, Tex.</p> <p></p> <p>10News spoke with family members of Johna Morvant and the Rasmussens. &nbsp;</p><p>Butch Rasmussen, grandfather to Peyton and Parker, who lives in Nebraska, told 10News in a phone interview that Peyton and Parker were visiting their mother for a few days. He described Peyton as being an extremely likeable young lady. He said her brother Parker was more of the quiet type but always had one or two friends around.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;I saw the news reports of a helicopter that crashed yesterday and five people were killed, and they showed the smoke coming up from the trees. And like everybody else, I&rsquo;m thinking &lsquo;Oh, what a sad story,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Butch Rasmussen. &ldquo;And then I went on about my business, not knowing that was my family...not understanding that those were my grandkids on that plane.&rdquo;</p><p>Their father, Scott Rasmussen, said Peyton and Parker had gone to visit their mom in East Tennessee three days ago. He said he texted them Monday afternoon and was surprised when he didn&#39;t hear from them. Then, he learned Tuesday morning that they&#39;d been in the helicopter accident.</p><p>&quot;They were just the light of my life and very loving kids, and I&rsquo;m still in shock and disbelief that they&rsquo;re not here anymore,&quot; Scott Rasmussen said. &quot;It&rsquo;s just really shocking right now that my kids went to go visit their mom and are never coming home.&quot;</p><p></p><p>He said Peyton was going to school to be a medical technician and Parker was a senior in high school.</p><p>&ldquo;They were such good kids. I&rsquo;m just going to miss them,&rdquo; said Butch Rasmussen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can say to you. I don&rsquo;t know what else to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>10News spoke briefly to the longtime girlfriend of the pilot, Jason Dahl, but she wasn&rsquo;t able to comment. A public post on her Facebook page was flooded with more than 80 comments memorializing Dahl and offering condolences. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He was an awesome, down to earth, funny guy. We all got along great,&rdquo; said Barb Nocula, a friend from the Chicago area. &ldquo;It&#39;s so sad.&rdquo;</p><p>She said Dahl had planned to pursue his dream of being a flight for life pilot.</p><p>WBIR&#39;s Charlotte affiliate was able to confirm Michael Glenn&nbsp;Mastalez&nbsp;was also originally from Huntersville, N.C. as well. An uncle of Peyton and Parker told WCNC that&nbsp;Mastalez was Peyton&#39;s boyfriend and the trip to Tennessee was partially taken so her mother could meet him.</p><p>The NTSB&nbsp;is expected to release a preliminary report on the crash by the end of next week. The final investigative report, however, likely will take a year.</p><p></p> ]]>

The passengers were Johna Morvant, 49, from Kodak and her two children, Peyton and Parker Rasmussen with Huntersville, NC addresses. Also killed in the crash was Michael Glenn Mastalez, 21, of Prosper, Tex.</p> <div align="center"> <img embed-content-articleid="undefined" embed-content-groupid="undefined" embed-content-id="121724349" embed-content-index="0" embed-content-type="PHOTO" src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/05/download_1459904123493_1409602_ver1.0_320_240.jpg" /></figure><p>10News spoke with family members of Johna Morvant and the Rasmussens. &nbsp;</p><p>Butch Rasmussen, grandfather to Peyton and Parker, who lives in Nebraska, told 10News in a phone interview that Peyton and Parker were visiting their mother for a few days. He described Peyton as being an extremely likeable young lady. He said her brother Parker was more of the quiet type but always had one or two friends around.&nbsp;</p><figure data-feedback="fb:likes, fb:comments"><img embed-content-articleid="undefined" embed-content-groupid="undefined" embed-content-id="121682110" embed-content-index="0" embed-content-type="PHOTO" src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/05/FIRE%20sevier%20co%20BLURRED_1459900539720_1408895_ver1.0_320_240.jpg" /></figure><p>&ldquo;I saw the news reports of a helicopter that crashed yesterday and five people were killed, and they showed the smoke coming up from the trees.

He said he texted them Monday afternoon and was surprised when he didn&#39;t hear from them. Then, he learned Tuesday morning that they&#39;d been in the helicopter accident.</p><p>&quot;They were just the light of my life and very loving kids, and I&rsquo;m still in shock and disbelief that they&rsquo;re not here anymore,&quot; Scott Rasmussen said. &quot;It&rsquo;s just really shocking right now that my kids went to go visit their mom and are never coming home.&quot;</p><figure data-feedback="fb:likes, fb:comments"><img embed-content-articleid="undefined" embed-content-groupid="undefined" embed-content-id="121682119" embed-content-index="0" embed-content-type="PHOTO" src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/05/family_1459900539762_1408896_ver1.0_320_240.jpg" /></figure><p>He said Peyton was going to school to be a medical technician and Parker was a senior in high school.</p><p>&ldquo;They were such good kids. I&rsquo;m just going to miss them,&rdquo; said Butch Rasmussen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can say to you. I don&rsquo;t know what else to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>10News spoke briefly to the longtime girlfriend of the pilot, Jason Dahl, but she wasn&rsquo;t able to comment. A public post on her Facebook page was flooded with more than 80 comments memorializing Dahl and offering condolences. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He was an awesome, down to earth, funny guy. We all got along great,&rdquo; said Barb Nocula, a friend from the Chicago area. &ldquo;It&#39;s so sad.&rdquo;</p><p>She said Dahl had planned to pursue his dream of being a flight for life pilot.</p><p>WBIR&#39;s Charlotte affiliate was able to confirm Michael Glenn&nbsp;Mastalez&nbsp;was also originally from Huntersville, N.C. as well. An uncle of Peyton and Parker told WCNC that&nbsp;Mastalez was Peyton&#39;s boyfriend and the trip to Tennessee was partially taken so her mother could meet him.</p><p>The NTSB&nbsp;is expected to release a preliminary report on the crash by the end of next week. The final investigative report, however, likely will take a year.</p><figure class="op-slideshow"> <figure> <img src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/04/scene5_1459821169776_1383402_ver1.0_320_180.png"> </figure> <figcaption> slideshow: Family, friends remember five victims of Pigeon Forge helicopter crash</figcaption> <figure> <img src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/04/scene1_1459821166355_1383401_ver1.0_320_180.png"> </figure> <figcaption> slideshow: Family, friends remember five victims of Pigeon Forge helicopter crash</figcaption> <figure> <img src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/04/scene4_1459821164321_1380600_ver1.0_320_180.png"> </figure> <figcaption> slideshow: Family, friends remember five victims of Pigeon Forge helicopter crash</figcaption> <figure> <img src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/04/scene2_1459821162275_1380599_ver1.0_320_180.png"> </figure> <figcaption> slideshow: Family, friends remember five victims of Pigeon Forge helicopter crash</figcaption> <figure> <img src="http://content.wbir.com/photo/2016/04/04/scene3_1459821160334_1380598_ver1.0_320_180.jpg"> </figure> <figcaption> slideshow: Family, friends remember five victims of Pigeon Forge helicopter crash</figcaption> </figure> </p> <figure class="op-tracker"> <iframe src="http://interactive.tegna-media.com/lakana/fia/assets/analytics.php?id=51&story=121684387&hls=false&category=600001&callsign=WBIR&article=Family,-friends-remember-five-victims-of-Pigeon-Forge-helicopter-crash&type=Facebook-Instant-Article&originurl=www.wbir.com/news/local/pigeon-forge-pd-identifies-five-victims-of-fatal-helicopter-crash/121684387" hidden> </iframe> </figure> <footer> <small> <a href="http://www.wbir.com">WBIR-TV</a> &copy; 2016 TEGNA MEDIA </small> </footer> </article> </body> </html>
