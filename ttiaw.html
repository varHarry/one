But &quot;spanking is linked with the same negative child outcomes as abuse, just to a slightly lesser degree.&quot;</p><p class="storyParagraph">Still, the practice appears to be widespread. A survey in 2002 showed nearly 80% of US preschoolers were spanked, <a href="http://mic.com/articles/141851/here-s-what-getting-spanked-as-a-kid-did-to-your-personality-according-to-science#.gqtL9hVJz" target="_blank">Mic</a> reports, a stat consistent with international numbers from UNICEF in 2014. And, according to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nfl-controversy/corporal-punishment-legal-common-n204416" target="_blank">NBC News</a>, a 2013 poll found 81% of Americans think spanking&mdash;&quot;technically legal&quot; in all 50 states&mdash;is &quot;sometimes appropriate.&quot;</p><p class="storyParagraph">Researchers argue that spanking continues not because it&#39;s effective but because children who are spanked grow up to become parents who spank. (The pope says it&#39;s <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/202328/pope-ok-to-smack-kid-but-avoid-face.html">OK to spank children</a>, but he&#39;s got some conditions.)</p>
